Please don't sue me for trying to fix a broken tool

Project was originally released by neil.fraser https://code.google.com/p/google-site-spider/
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/site-spider/ddlodfbcplakmddhdlffebcggbbighda?hl=en

This is a fork of that project. Slightly different output format, and updated to the new manifest version.

New features include: 
The ability to pause the spider. 
The ability to stop the spider from the results page.

Major bug fix:
It works in Chrome again.
